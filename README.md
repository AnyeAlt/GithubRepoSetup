# Setting up a GitHub Repository
How to setup a github repository with vscode and a terminal.

1. Go to your terminal, and type `git`.
  If you have git, then it will show you a list of commands that you can try.
  If you DON'T have git, then it will say `git is not a command`. 
    Go to https://git-scm.com/ to download it.
2. Make sure that your project has it's own folder on your computer. In other words, put all the files from your project into one folder.
3. Change into that folder by running `cd 'exDirectory/'`. Make sure it's the right one.
4. Add a remote: `git remote add origin 'githubURL'`
